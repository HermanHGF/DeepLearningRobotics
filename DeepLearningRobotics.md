##the World's First Makerable Deep Learning Robot, aka MDLR

the Makerable Deep Learning Robot, powered by Nvidia Jetson, Caffe, and DQN

##Architecture of the Robot

integrated with:

* Hardware side
 * Nvidia [Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/get-started-jetson) Embedded Tegra Computing
 * Autonomous Vehicle
 * Camera Head by Servo
* on MDLR2.0
 * portable robotics arm //[uARM](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ufactory/uarm-put-a-miniature-industrial-robot-arm-on-your/description), MDLR2.0
 * DepthCamera //[DepthSense DS325](http://myzharbot.robot-home.it/blog/software/myzharbot-ros/ros-deptsense_camera_ros/) | [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Gesture-Recognition-Personal-Computers/dp/B00EVWX7CG)
 * a LCD/micro projector? //MDLR2.0
* Software side
 * Caffe
 * [DQN](https://gist.github.com/NirViaje/7ca109d2e99d0b16ec43#dqn)
 * SLAM, like [LSD](https://github.com/tum-vision/lsd_slam/issues/53)
 * APIs integrated with the hardware driver
*
