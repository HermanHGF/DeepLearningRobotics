# DeepLearningRobotics
for integrating Deep Learning and Robotics

Basically, there are two thread now:

* [DeepLearningRobot.md](https://github.com/NirViaje/DeepLearningRobotics/blob/master/DeepLearningRobot.md)
* [DeepLearningHandsOn.md](https://github.com/NirViaje/DeepLearningRobotics/blob/master/DeepLearningHandsOn.md)

##Architecture

the Architecture of the Robot is suggested as following:

* Hardware side
 * Nvidia [Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/get-started-jetson) Embedded Tegra Computing
 * Autonomous Vehicle
 * Camera Head by Servo
 * portable robotics arm //[uARM](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ufactory/uarm-put-a-miniature-industrial-robot-arm-on-your/description), MDLR2.0
* Software side
 * Caffe
 * [DQN](https://gist.github.com/NirViaje/7ca109d2e99d0b16ec43#dqn)
 * APIs integrated with the hardware driver
 *
