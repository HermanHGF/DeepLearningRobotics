h#On the New Era of Computing

##Agenda

the brain
* what our brain is
* eg., some works from a berkeley lab

neuron morphological computing, //bio-mimic
* how neuron works
* FACETS
** Blue brain
* [SyNAPSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyNAPSE)
** bring cat out of bag
** IBM [TrueNorth](http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml)
* others

Computational model of (understanding) from typical computer scientist's eyes
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/)
** Pattern Recognition
** Statistical Learning
* on Tuning Machine

the deep revolution, started by Geoffrey Hinton
* works back from 30 years ago
* how to deep
* history of the Hinton family

Hardware deep learning accelerator (on chip)
* CPU/SIMD/GPU/FPGA
* the ending Moore's law for tuning machine (or say von Neumann machine)
** the biggest acquiration in history for Intel, Intel acquired Altera
** CAS Diannao series
** Horizontal Tech, by Kai Yu, Ex-Baiduer, former leader of Baidu IDL
** the Synopsys IP, 1Tops/W
** Mobileye
** to name a few //other vendors/projects
* the progress, low power high computational density, the Singularity book
* review, new era for computation, the left/right brain for silicon

What we can do from now, and here (eg., XCJ)
* Caffe, the DL tools chain/environment, eg., matlab toolbox
** online demo
* the Nvidia Jetson
** some resource (eg., [jetsonhacks](jetsonhacks.com)
** Caffe on Jetson, 34ms for (ImgNet)
* the [DeepLearningRobotics](https://github.com/NirViaje/DeepLearningRobotics/new/master) //godaddy
** Caffe/DQN/..

Thanks
