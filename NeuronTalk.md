#On the New Era of Computing

##Agenda

the brain
* what our brain is
* eg., some works from a berkeley lab

neuron morphological computing, //bio-mimic
* FACETS
 * Blue brain
* [SyNAPSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SyNAPSE)
 * bring cat out of bag
 * IBM [TrueNorth](http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml)
* others

Computational model from typical computer scientist's eyes
* [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/cmbishop/prml/)
 * Pattern Recognition
 * Statistical Learning
* on Tuning Machine

the deep revolution, started by Geoffrey Hinton
* works back from 30 years ago
* how to deep
* history of the Hinton family

Hardware deep learning accelerator (on chip)
* the ending Moore's law for tuning machine (or say von Neumann machine)
 * the efficiency of silicon footprint
* Emergence in the silicon world
 * the biggest acquiration in history for Intel, Intel acquired Altera
 * CAS Diannao series
 * Horizontal Tech, by Kai Yu, Ex-Baiduer, the  former leader of Baidu IDL
 * the Synopsys IP
 * Mobileye
 * to name a few //other vendors/projects
* review, the singularity metaphor of computation capacity, new era for computation, the left/right brain for silicon

What we can do from now, and here (eg., XCJ)
* Caffe, the DL tools chain/environment
 * online demo
* the Nvidia Jetson
 * some resource (eg., [jetsonhacks](jetsonhacks.com)
 * Caffe on Jetson
* the [DeepLearningRobotics](https://github.com/NirViaje/DeepLearningRobotics/new/master) //godaddy

Thanks

##Appendix

###two fundamental problem on theoritical computer science

* computational complexity (mostly on model of tuning machine or likely)
* artificial intelligence

建议的标题：

* 图灵计算与深度计算，硅上的左脑与右脑*

关键词摘要（其实我更愿意作为标题）：
* 脑，神经认知计算与硅实现，深度学习，深度硬件加速器，以及在新车间我们能够干嘛


|| *左右脑这个称呼并不精确，但是鉴于这个被误用的概念为人们熟知所以在这里作为一个隐喻

报告材料没做完，也可能就这么用 -
